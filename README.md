# PowerHarness
PowerHarness is a framework for allowing PowerShell scripts to be written quickly but including a robust, standardized feature set, including logging, email, and other capabilities.

**Example:**
```powershell
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'
Import-Module "$PSScriptRoot\PowerHarness\PowerHarness.psm1"
$ph = Get-PowerHarness -scriptPath $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path

$ph.RunScript({
  $ph.Logger.Info("Hello World!") # logs optionally write to console, file, and/or database
  $ph.Logger.Error("This is an error") # any thrown errors or logged errors can trigger an automation email notification
})
```
# Installation
PowerHarness is not currently in any package manager.  You can simply copy the PowerHarness folder to your script directory.
