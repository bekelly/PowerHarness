# PowerHarness

## ON DECK
- enable/disable file logging
- enable/disable console logging
- notification email template setup (maybe this becomes a configuration option in the base that can be overriden?)
- version tracking? (talk to copilot and see if this is a thing that is manageable)
- convert BAYSHORE to new platform
- SQL module
- timesheet tracker
- VMware workstation backer upper

## DONE
- refactor as PowerShell modules
